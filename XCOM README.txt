this is a mod that makes quake 4 more of a tactical shooter
crosshair has been turned off, so aim straight
player is given full health and armor
enemies to alot more damage and have more health
you do less damage, take cover!
because there is no cover system in this game, crouching speed is upped so you can move from cover to cover
